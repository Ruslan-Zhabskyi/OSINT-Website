# OSINT-Website
https://ruslan-zhabskyi-assigment-1.netlify.app

Reflection:
As the baseline I used one of the website layouts we went through during modules 1- 6. Container consists of a 3 column grid and the main content splits into 2 columns: primary and secondary. Footer has also been included.
To generate content I prepared notes on what should be on the website and used chatGPT to generate the text.
The website has articles, an investigation case to showcase the OSINT methodology and a podcast section. Media includes a photo of a dog and a video with the dog (“Investigations” section), and audio (“Podcasts” section) all of which were created by me, all externally sourced resources are mentioned below.
The “About Us” section contains an embedded Google map. This was obtained by copying the code from google.com/maps.
For this project I was inspired by the colours and look of https://kyivindependent.com/ website. Black and white are the main colours which create a simple, but formal design. Grey, which is the mix of both, organically added to the very back and makes all sections pop creating a more pleasing look. A slight touch of purple colour in the navigation is used to create a feel of wisdom and power.
The main objectives for the website typography were to be simple and readable, yet modern. I used font-family Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, as those are suitable for this type of content. To make it easier to read I added more space between letters and increased line height.
As highlighted in the table above, the website structure contains stylesheets, grid, navigation, templates and semantic objects.
I had a great time creating it, and I'm excited to acquire fresh techniques to enhance its professional appearance.

Known bugs/problems: navigation has not been moved to partials as it was causing issues to the original style.
